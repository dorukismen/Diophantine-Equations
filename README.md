# Diophantine-Equations
Solving two unknown parameter equations ( Diophantine Equations)

This solution is taken from  "http://new.math.uiuc.edu/public348/python/jimcarlsonpy.pdf" and the following paragraphs are taken from the same site.

We will use the recursive implementation of the Euclidean algorithm to design a function isolve
for solving the Diophantine equation
ax + by = c. (1)
Such equations are solvable if and only if the gcd(a, b) divides c. First note that if b divides a then
we can write down a solution:
x = 0, y = c/b.
If b does not divide a, write a = bq + r as in the (long) divsion algorithm and then substitute into
(1):
(bq + r)x + by = c.
Rearrange as
b(qx + y) + rx = c.
Set
u = qx + y, v = x
and substitute again to obtain the equation
bu + rv = c. (2)
We have reduced the equation (1) to the equivalent equation (2) with smaller coefficients. If we
can solve the new equation, then we recover a solution of the old equation by the formulas
x = v, y = u âˆ’ qv.

The process eventually terminates (by the theory of the Euclidean algorithm) with an equaiton
where the second coefficient divides the first.
These ideas are embodied in the Python code below. Note the use of the divmod operation to
compute the quotient and remainder at the same time. The function divmod returns a pair of
numbers, the quotient and remainder, which we store in q, r. Note also the use of lists for the
return value.
